# pybot - A Minecraft bot written in Python using Mineflayer

pybot is a Minecraft bot written using the Mineflayer framework via the Python to Javascript bridge. It is built for practical utility automating such tasks as mining for resources, mining out rooms or long corridors, building bridges, farming, chopping wood, building structures and moving around resources between chests. It has a partially complete UI written in Tk.

Tested with Java Edition 1.16.5.

## Requirements

To run the bot, your system needs to have:
- A recent version of Python. On macOS, easiest is to install Python 3 from the www.python.org web site. Homebrew python may require the additional install of tkinter.
- The python/javascript bridge. 'pip3 install javascript' should do the trick.

## Setup

Copy the account_sample.py to account/account.py and edit the following fields:
- User Name
- Password
- Server IP or name
- "master" is the in-game name of the player that the bot should take commands from (i.e. your in-game name)
- version to the server's minecraft version

You can also specify locations in this file. This is mostly useful to have the bot transfer contents between chests.

Normally the bot will open a Window, but you can also run it without any graphical UX using the "--nowindow" option.

## Functionality

Simple commands are given via chat. The bot has a specific "master" player that it will listen to. Try "come", "inventory" or "status" to get an idea. Other users can also give commands but need to preface it with a callsign.

Many activities can be stopped with the command "stop". 

PyBot starts most complex activities around a chest. There are two types:
- For an activity that dodesn't need a specifi direction like farming an area, it's just a chest. Material (e.g. seeds) and resources (e.g. wheat) will be taken from or, after collecting them, placed into that chest.
- For activities that do have a direction (e.g. dig a tunnel in a specific direction), starting point is a chest and the direction is indicated by placing a torch on the ground directly next to the chest. 

For these activities, have the bot come next to the chest and once it is there tell it to "farm" or "mine 3x3".

### Farming

To start, place a chest in the area you want to farm and start with "farm". The bot will take seeds from the cest, and plant them in any nearby farmland that it can reach. If there are fully grown crops, the pot will harvest them and place them and any extra seeds in the chest. Chat "stop" to stop the bot. Right now, only Wheat is in the code, but other crops are easy to add.

### Chop Wood

Right now only works with mega spruce trees as they are the most efficient. Plant 2x2 saplings and get a tree with up to 100 blocks of wood. Place a chest within 25 blocks from the tree, put a few stone axes and bread as food in the chest and start with "chop". The bot will do a spiral cut up the trunk and then cut down. It will continue to chop down trees as long as it finds them and deposit the wood into the chest.

Right now, this activity can't be aborted with stop.

### Mining

Supports:
- Use "mine fast" to start strip mining. By default it will clear a 11 wide and 9 high area of all valuable blocks (it can see through walls to find it)
- Mine large corridors, try "mine 3x3" or "mine 5x5"
- The bot will looking for valuable ores off corridors, usually with a default distance of 5
- The bot will also look in ceilings and the floow up to 2 deep
- Try "boxmine" to mine out large areas for underground rooms
- The bot will automatically bridge across chasms/lava
- It will not defend itself yet, but it will run away when taking damage and ninja-log when below 50%
- It will light up tunnels
- If you put a wall sign close to the chest, the bot will record its progress on that sign (e.g. length of tunnel, dangers etc.)

If there is a chest-in-a-minecart next to the starting chest, the bot will deposit into the minecart, and restock from the chest. That makes it easy to keep it supplied with tools while hauling away resources automatically

### Movement

Try "come" to make the bot come to the player

### Building

Still early, but if you add a blueprint to bulueprint_list.py, the bot can build it. Starting point is a chest with a torch. The bot can build a full sorting system with "build sorter".
